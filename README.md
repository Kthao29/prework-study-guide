# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

The prework-study-guide helps me put the information of what I learned during the orientation into a website. This will help me with understanding and remembering what I did in orientation. I learned about what role HTLM, CSS, and Javascript contribute to when working on a webpage.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
Each of the section contains information we learned during orientation. For example, there is notes on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Gitbhub. Git is useful for when we want to create a branch and work on the project so we do not mess up the main branch where our project will be merged with.
